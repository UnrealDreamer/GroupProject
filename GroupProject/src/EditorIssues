Editor Issues:
	When deleting the audio file the file is still there. (Possible solution.
				 Keep the files you want to delete in a list then run a for loop when editor is closed to delete each audio file)
 	Error with replaying a audio file for a non-existing word
Issues to fix during are last week.
 	Timer doesn't work.
 	Button Color doesn't change back to indicate recording has stopped.
